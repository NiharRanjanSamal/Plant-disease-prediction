# Plant-disease-prediction
🔍 Overview
This project uses Machine Learning (ML) techniques to predict plant diseases from leaf images. The goal is to assist farmers and agriculturists in early disease detection and prevention, thereby minimizing crop losses and ensuring better yield.

Using a convolutional neural network (CNN), the model can classify plant leaves as healthy or diseased and further identify the specific disease category.

🎯 Objectives
Detect plant diseases from leaf images.
Classify multiple plant species and their common diseases.
Provide a user-friendly interface for practical use (optional extension).
Encourage smart agriculture using AI tools.

## 📌 Features
- Upload plant leaf images through the website interface.
- Detect and classify plant diseases using a trained CNN model.
- Display prediction results with disease name and possible remedies.
- User-friendly and responsive web design.

### Fig 4.2 Website Interface (Landing Page)
This is the landing page of the website, which serves as the entry point for users.  
It provides a simple and user-friendly interface where users can navigate to different sections of the system, such as uploading plant images for disease detection.
