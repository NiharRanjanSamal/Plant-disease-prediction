# Plant-disease-prediction
🔍 Overview
This project uses Machine Learning (ML) techniques to predict plant diseases from leaf images. The goal is to assist farmers and agriculturists in early disease detection and prevention, thereby minimizing crop losses and ensuring better yield.

Using a convolutional neural network (CNN), the model can classify plant leaves as healthy or diseased and further identify the specific disease category.

🎯 Objectives
Detect plant diseases from leaf images.
Classify multiple plant species and their common diseases.
Provide a user-friendly interface for practical use (optional extension).
Encourage smart agriculture using AI tools.
